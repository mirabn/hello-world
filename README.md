# Overview

This repository contains data from [Jeon et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/408518v1).  Specifically, it contains the peak matrix generated by XCMS and used to create the heatmap in Supplementary S2.

# Contents:

1.  `README.md`: this file.
2. `annotated_heatmap.png` A heatmap with color-coding by sample and indicating with a red line which XCMS features correspond to falcarindiol.
3. `base_heatmap.png` Same as #2 above but without sample- and falcarindiol color-coding.
4. `heatmap_induced_metabolite.ipynb` the Jupyter notebook used to create the plots.
5. `metabolite_induction_analysis_20180901.csv` the peak matrix from our XCMS analysis
